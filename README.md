## Installation & Setup
*Having errors with a fresh Angel installation? See [here](https://github.com/angel-dart/angel/wiki/Installation-&-Setup) for help.*

Once you have [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) installed, bootstrapping a project is as simple as running one shell command:

Install the [Angel CLI](https://github.com/angel-dart/cli):

```bash
pub global activate angel_cli
```

Bootstrap a project:

```bash
angel init hello
```

You can even have your server run and be hot-reloaded on file changes:

```dart
angel start
```

Next, check out the [detailed documentation](https://github.com/angel-dart/angel/wiki) to learn to flesh out your project.

## What is Angel?
Angel is a server-side Web application framework for the Dart programming language. It strives to be a flexible, extensible system, to be easily scalable, and to allow as much code to be shared between clients and servers as possible. Ultimately, I believe that this approach will shorten the time it takes to build a full-stack Web application, from start to finish.
